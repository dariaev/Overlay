Swiper is a mobile application (Android) that allows users to create, use and share "Overlays" - transparent images that can be embedded onto their pictures. Swipe is social, so users can explore Trending overlays, popular ones nearby, from their friends, as well as search by tag.  Once an Overlay is chosen, it is attached to a picture (either new or pre-existing) and the resulting image can be shared via any social media platform (e,g, Instagram).  

Swiper curates millions of transparent images that our algorithms show have a high probability of being an awesome Overlay for your image!
